# Philosophy:
1. Stable is perfection.
2. OK is functional.
3. Unstable is a work in progress.
4. `master` is always stable.
5. Releases are created from `master`.
6. `dev` is the primary development branch.
7. `dev` is almost always stable.
8. `dev` is merged into `master` when `dev` is stable.
9. New features branch from `dev`.
10. New features merge into `hot` when they are OK.
11. `hot` merges into `dev` when `hot` is stable.
